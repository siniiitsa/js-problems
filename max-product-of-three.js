/*
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] (0 ≤ P < Q < R < N).

For example, array A such that:

  A[0] = -3
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = -2
  A[4] = 5
  A[5] = 6

contains the following example triplets:

(0, 1, 2), product is −3 * 1 * 2 = −6
(1, 2, 4), product is 1 * 2 * 5 = 10
(2, 4, 5), product is 2 * 5 * 6 = 60

Your goal is to find the maximal product of any triplet.

Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given a non-empty array A, returns the value of the maximal product of any triplet.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = -3
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = -2
  A[4] = 5
  A[5] = 6

the function should return 60, as the product of triplet (2, 4, 5) is maximal.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [3..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].

function solution(A) {
  let maxProduct = -Infinity;

  for (let P = 0; P < A.length - 2; ++P) {
    for (let Q = P + 1; Q < A.length - 1; ++Q) {
      for (let R = Q + 1; R < A.length; ++R) {
        const product = A[P] * A[Q] * A[R];
        if (product > maxProduct) maxProduct = product;
      }
    }
  }

  return maxProduct;
